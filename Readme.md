Complementary Infrastructure.
=============================
We live in a new age of automation, where the bins talk to the street lights and the busses converse with the traffic signals.
Sensors, tiny computers, powerful motors and effective batteries have all combined to make the impossible possible.  We expect that the autonomous car will take over from the driver and that it will not drive in the same way.  Why use vision alone when all other traffic is intelligent, and the roads, and the whole place, is intelligent?
This model has five computers: an Arduino, an RFID reader, a complex 3 axis multiple sensor and a mobile phone.  It has four power supplies.  It has 14 sensors.  It can run for three hours on one set of AA batteries.  It follows a magnetic stripe, watches for pedestrians, and responds to RFID tags.  It carefully monitors its own speed and position.  Using all these myriad signals it efficiently gets from place to place.
It is a miracle that demonstrates the integrated and complemetary infrastructure.
